# Model Assumptions and Limitations

## Key Assumptions

- **Data Representativeness**: Validation data represents recent origination periods
- **Economic Stationarity**: Model assumes stable macroeconomic environment
- **Feature Stability**: Input features maintain similar distributions over time

## Known Limitations

- **Use Case**: Model designed for risk segmentation only
- **Stress Scenarios**: Extreme economic conditions not covered in validation
- **Pricing**: Do not use for pricing without additional analysis
